<h1 align="center">BetterCopperGolem<br></h1>
<p align="center">A small mods that tweaks vanilla golem AI</p>
<p align="center">Simple AI improvements like remembering the last moved stack and bundle+shulker sorting</p>
<h2 align="center">Expanded lil fella's RAM</h2>
<p align="center"><img title="this gif took a megabyte of project space" src="https://github.com/GHOSTSHAURMA/BetterCopperGolem/blob/main/media/golem_better_memory.gif" align="center"/></p>
<p align="justify">&emsp;Copper golems can now remeber the item stack they moved last and will prioritise moving items of the same type. Not only that but they will stop double-checking chests as long as they are carrying the same item type</p>
<h2 align="center">Improved bundle and shulker box sorting</h2>
<p align="center"><img title="this gif took a megabyte of project space" src="https://github.com/GHOSTSHAURMA/BetterCopperGolem/blob/main/media/golem_container_sorting.gif" align="center"/></p>
<p align="justify">&emsp;Golems will now place undyed bundles into the chest only if there already is a bundle that contains at least all of the same items the bundle in golen's hands. If you dye the bundle it will instead be sorted by it's color so keep that in mind. All of that also goes for shulker boxes!</p>
<h2 align="center">Extras and Configuration</h2>
<p align="justify">&emsp;There are some cool off-by-default features in config that you can turn on to make your golems even more useful! Also stuff like golem carry capacity and maximum ammount of chests golems visit can be tweaked there (I have left these unlimited so you can have fun but if you set it to something stupid and it eaths your world, I am NOT responsible).</p>
<h2 align="center">TODO</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Add config menu</li>
  <li>Move "last_item_stack" tag into memories</li>
  <li>MAYBE make a custom MoveItemsTask class<br>
  <sup>tho it might cause compatability issues so maybe no</sup>
  </li>
</ul>
